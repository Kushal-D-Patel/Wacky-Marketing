# Wacky-Marketing
Manipulated a graph network to create an algorithm that identifies brand matches for the clients of the fictional, Wacky Store.
allUsers is global variable representing a linked list data structure holding a collection of all registered users on our platform. The linked list is sorted in alphabetical order by the user’s name. Assume that all names in the linked list are  unique.
Every struct user_struct represents a single user on the platform. For each user, we have a linked list of all the friends that they follow, as well as a linked list of all the brands that they like. Once again, both lists are sorted in alphabetical order by either the brand’s name or the friend’s name.
Every brand on the platform is stored inside an array of names under the variable brand_names.
